3 major components:
-reading a file
-parsing the file content
-outputing a file

parsing the file content:
-2 types of statements:
1.ignored statements (comment, white space)
2.instruction statements (A-intstruction, C-instruction)
3.labels

comments and white space:
-should be totally ignored

labels:
-rules:
1.be all in uppercase
2.should end with a colon ':'
3.should contain only letters
4.should be totally removed from source code
5.should ensure whether it's already added to the sympols table or not
6.should be added to the list of labels

instructions:

types of supported tokens:
@, +, A, D, ;, JGT, JMP, JEQ, JGE, JLT, JNE, JLE

A-Instruction
rules:
-should start with @
-there should be no space after the @
-allowed expressions after @ is:
 1.label
 2.literal number at most 16 bit numberr
 3.other lowercase labels are considered variables

interpretation of A instruction:
-first bit is 0
-the next 15 bit is one of the following:
 1.if a label -> it should be replaced with an address from labels list
 2.if a constant -> convert the value directly into binary
 3.if a variable -> if the variable exists get its address, if the variable is a new one get the last added variable address + 1 then convert it to binary
